Smart Parking system is used for finding free parking slots within The Technion. 

Given the location and the customer details, the system will provide location of the nearest available parking slot and will update in real time in case of nearer parking slot became available. The system will present a map of the Technion with mapping of the parking slots and navigates the customer toward the chosen parking slot, in addition there will be a possibility to communicate with other car owners.
